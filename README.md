# mySidewalkFrontend

For this coding challenge I used Mapbox GL JS and Hightcharts to display data provided to me in two GeoJSON layers. The framework was done all in Bootstrap with minimal inline CSS. I tried to use Mocha and Chai to setup testing but ran into issues due to Mapbox that I was unable to solve.

To run locally you will need to have a Mapbox access token. You will also need to run npm i to install the node packages.
