# mySidewalkFrontend

For this coding challenge I used Mapbox GL JS and Hightcharts to display data provided to me in two GeoJSON layers. The framework was done all in Bootstrap with minimal inline CSS. I tried to use Mocha and Chai to setup testing but ran into issues due to Mapbox that I was unable to solve.

Simply go to the GitHub Pages link above. If downloading to run you will need a Mapbox access token and to install the npm packages.
